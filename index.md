Vienna, Austria
Paris, France

_September 2021 - October 2024_

- At Jumio, based in Vienna, Austria, and Paris, France, I served as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I was instrumental in designing and implementing end-to-end machine learning and data pipelines. My responsibilities included:
  - Document Classification: I fine-tuned foundational pre-trained language models from Hugging Face, using hundreds of thousands of images from our in-house dataset to enhance classification accuracy.
  - Information Extraction: I developed a robust pipeline that employed GCP OCR for text extraction, followed by Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagging to extract structured data such as names and addresses in multiple languages.
  - Data and ML Pipelines: I automated data pipelines using Apache Airflow and PySpark, continuously updating our offline feature store, training, and validation datasets.
  - MLOps Implementation: I built automated ML pipelines for model retraining and deployment, ensuring that our production systems were always up to date with the latest model improvements.
  - Tech Stack: My work involved technologies like PyTorch Lightning, AWS SageMaker, Apache Airflow, PySpark, MLflow, Docker, Jenkins, AWS ECR/ECS, and Datadog.

## **AI Researcher** _at_ Orange
